        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            For as long as I can remember, I have had a fascination in assembling various gadgets, fixing something if it is broken, and generally wanting to know how "things" work. From building a Meccano race car set as a kid, to undertaking small engine repairs on a lawn mower that wouldn't quite run properly at the age of 14, it has always been evident that I enjoy working with my hands. Today, I am now able to diagnose and repair issues with my car; there is no better feeling than when the check engine light disappears because of a repair that I accomplished. Although not every undertaking of mine proved to be a success story, it is these experiences that introduced me to the compelling world of engineering. 

            Now in 2026, I am 23 years old and graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering Science (BESc), majoring in Mechatronic Systems at Western University in London, Ontario. It was in my undergraduate studies where I got to combine my passion for engineering with my passion for learning and understanding new things. Now, I am eager to apply these passions and kickstart my career in engineering!
