        "\n",
        "A C-arm [fluoroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoroscopy) system is a specialized medical imaging device used primarily in surgical and interventional procedures. It consists of a C-shaped arm that houses an X-ray source on one end and a detector on the other. This configuration allows for real-time imaging of internal structures, organs, and tissues, aiding surgeons and interventional radiologists during procedures. Fluoroscopy is ubiquitously employed in [cardiovascular](https://www.jacc.org/action/showCitFormats?doi=10.1016/j.jacc.2004.10.014) [\\[1\\]](#Bibliography), [endovascular](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11548-018-1779-6) [\\[2\\]](#Bibliography), [orthopedic](https://journals.lww.com/jaaos/abstract/2019/10010/the_role_of_intraoperative_navigation_in.3.aspx) [\\[3\\]](#Bibliography), and [neurointerventions](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00586-011-2011-3) [\\[4\\]](#Bibliography), as well as for [pain management](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11916-018-0660-1) [\\[5\\]](#Bibliography) and [biopsies](https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/radiology.220.1.r01jl29161) [\\[6\\]](#Bibliography) across diverse anatomical targets. To facilitate the positioning and orientation of the surgical instrument, the mobile C-arm must be positioned efficiently and accurately to obtain the desired radiographic view, leading to repeated image acquisitions known as [**fluoro-hunting**](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-medical-imaging/volume-5/issue-1/015005/Virtual-fluoroscopy-for-intraoperative-C-arm-positioning-and-radiation-dose/10.1117/1.JMI.5.1.015005.short) [\\[7\\]](#Bibliography). To assess the depth of a surgical instrument, the C-arm must be oriented at a 90-degree angle from the instrument’s trajectory and, after the depth is assessed, revert to the original pose to reassess the instrument trajectory. The necessity to reposition the C-arm and perform repeated image acquisition stems from the 2D projective nature of the X-ray radiograph. This contributes to the main limitations of fluoroscopy-guided interventions, namely the loss of depth perception and prolonged radiation exposure for both the [patient](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051044309003443) [\\[8\\]](#Bibliography) and [medical staff](https://www.ajronline.org/doi/10.2214/AJR.16.16556) [\\[9\\]](#Bibliography).\n"
